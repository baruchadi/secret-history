# The Secret History of the Boca Raton Computer Science Club

The Secret History of the Mongols was "was written for the Mongol royal family some time after Genghis Khan's death in AD 1227" ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_History_of_the_Mongols)) to maintain the legend, the history, and the culture of the Mongols past the death of the great Khan. This book was never supposed to be seen by any human other than the royal Mongolian family, that did not work out so well (may or may not be associated with Wikileaks).

This repository is the Boca Raton CSC's own *secret history*. Except not so secret as it is open sourced, hello world.

To see the actually history take a peak at the CHANGELOG.md file.
