# Changelog
A half-objective overly-dramatisized version of the Boca Raton CSC history by year. Send a pull request for changes.

Each year will have the following sections:
- **Noteable Figures**: a handful of the most important people and their twitters
- **History**: a breif record of things that happened during the year
- **Presidential Reflections**: reflections of the president for what had happened over the year
- **Next Year Goals**: goals of the arising leadership for the next year

From here on out, years will be denoted by *AG* (*Anno de Gabe*, which means *Year of our Gabriel*) to honor the founder of the club. 0 AG aligns with the 2014-2015 school year.

### History
Gabe Timotei was a senior when he finally decided to take the leap and create the Boca Raton Computer Science Club. Torn by allegiances to Cross Country (we think) and DECA he made time to found our club. In the beginning there was competition between who would be the first to create such a club. Yet Gabe, through means we might never know rose victorious.

The first aim of the club was to create a new website for Boca Raton failed, so Gabe in his benevolence delivered the first lecture to the young computer scientists on HTML. It could have been better, sorry Gabe. Over the next couple of weeks an advertisement for the computer science club was aired, attracting many new hackers to the cause. Also over this time period it was quickly discovered that the hackers were not yet *hacky* enough to successfully complete the website project. Thus it was retired for perhaps another year.

After attempting HTML, CSS, and Javascript, the club leadership took a poll. This poll returned that the hackers present thought they really just wanted to make videogames. So the direction was changed to instead try *Java*. After many meetings of fumbling around, Java was determined to not be what would be best for the club.

Thus it was decided to create a competition-ready hackathon-winning club and they would be web developers!

Gabe, Caleb, and Justin decided to go to the first hackathon of which they would develop an app using *MeteorJS*. The result of this hackathon can be found [here](https://github.com/Boca-High-CSC/0204150-project34). This creation won the team a 3D printer which is totally awesome.

### Presidential Reflections

### Next Year Goals
- Win more hackathons
- Create a legacy for the Boca Raton CSC
- Enable many competent computer scientists
